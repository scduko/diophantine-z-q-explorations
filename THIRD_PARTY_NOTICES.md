# Third-party sources and dependencies

Project licensing applies only to original project material. It does not relicense the upstream software, papers, source excerpts, or theory files referenced or preserved by this project. Keep any notices supplied with those materials.

## Mathematical sources

- Sohail Farhangi with ChatGPT 6, [*A conditional Diophantine definition of Z in Q from four arithmetic inputs*](October%2011%20Manuscript/ZIsDiophantineInQBySohailsGPT-6.pdf), October 11, 2026. The manuscript is preserved without modification alongside its [provenance and comparison notes](October%2011%20Manuscript/README.md). Its provenance is separate from the current Version 6 collaboration credit.
- OpenAI, [*Hilbert's tenth problem over the rational numbers*](https://github.com/openai/math/blob/main/preprints/Hilberts-tenth-problem-over-the-rational-numbers-October-6-2026/main.pdf), October 6, 2026. This is a mathematical input cited by the manuscripts in this repository, not a proof produced by this repository.
- Jonas Bayer, Marco David, Benedikt Stock, Abhik Pal, Yuri Matiyasevich, and Dierk Schleicher, [*Diophantine Equations and the DPRM Theorem*](https://isa-afp.org/entries/DPRM_Theorem.html), Archive of Formal Proofs, June 6, 2022. The entry is distributed under the BSD license linked on its page. The alpha-sequence and exponentiation constructions are credited in the relevant project sources. The curated construction directory does not vendor the Isabelle development.
- Other mathematical sources for [Version 3](manuscripts/archive/quartic_9625.pdf) are identified in its bibliography and [dependency evidence](docs/quartic-9625/README.md). The October 11 manuscript has its own bibliography. Historical review reports preserve their particular citations and scope.

## Version 9 contribution

Gabriel Conant with ChatGPT supplied the November 7, 2026 odd-product reduction and the November 6 point-chart note. The contributed files in `quartics/quartic-523-540/` preserve their credits. `INTEGRATION.json` identifies the exact source archive and the two verifier repairs. The current manuscript incorporates these arguments and explicitly connects their inherited inputs to its earlier proofs. The original project license does not relicense contributed or cited third-party material.

## Version 6 sources

The current manuscript credits the collective agentic notes of Stefan Baranczuk, Jose Brox, Gabe Conant, Sohail Farhangi, James Freitag, Elliot Glazer, Jennifer Park, and Caroline Terry. The 962-variable construction continues the independent reconstruction described below, with its own source changes and checks. The degree-four obstruction also follows the public improvements notes. The [Version 6 inventory](docs/quartic-962/README.md) binds each application to its exact source and review scope.

Version 6 proves the required fixed Gaussian ray-field special case within the manuscript rather than assuming Frei–Tinková's theorem. Their work remains credited for the method. The replacement uses published results whose exact inspected versions are recorded in the inventory; no blanket claim is made that all final publisher texts were accessible. Downloaded reference articles and page images used for this new research are identified by source metadata and hashes rather than included in the new research directory.

## Version 5 sources, preserved

The Version 5 quartic reconstructs formulas from José Brox's [public improvements manuscript](https://github.com/JoseBrox/diophantine-z-q_improvements), pinned by commit and hash in the [package provenance](quartics/quartic-1272/PROVENANCE.json). Brox receives credit for the shared-point construction, detector formulas, fixed scales and affine anchor change. The reconstruction, gate program and independent checking are identified separately. This is not a redistribution of an unavailable original coefficient archive.

Zhi-Wei Sun's [arXiv:2610.20691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.20691) supplies the simultaneous prime-pattern argument. The manuscript includes its application and the audited derivation, with individual published and preprint inputs recorded in the [Version 5 inventory](docs/quartic-1272/README.md). In particular, publication status for Frei–Tinková is not inferred from its arXiv upload. Preserved source material retains its own authorship and terms; repository licensing applies only to original project material.

## November 6 supplied research

The mathematical articles and ledgers under `research/2026-11-06-collaborator-notes/supplied/` were supplied for this collaborative project. They remain unchanged and retain their printed credits and terms. The two standalone PDFs were described as notes from Sohail Farhangi's collaborator; no more specific authorship is inferred. `SUPPLIED_SOURCES.json` records every source and hash. The repository license does not relicense these documents. The comparison and height-replacement note distinguish their claims from the current manuscript's accepted inputs.

## Build and proof dependencies

| Dependency | License/source of terms | How it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lean 4 | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/v4.35.0/LICENSE) | Compiler and proof kernel; installed separately |
| Mathlib 4 and its dependencies | [Mathlib license](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/v4.35.0/LICENSE), plus each dependency's notices | Imported by Lean; exact repositories and revisions are in `lean/lake-manifest.json` |
| Tectonic | [Upstream licenses](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/tree/tectonic%400.17.0) | Downloaded, hash-checked paper compiler; not committed here |
| TeX packages and fonts | Notices in the pinned Tectonic/TeX bundle and the respective package sources | Downloaded build inputs; not committed here |
| GitHub Actions | Each pinned action's upstream license | CI orchestration; referenced by commit hash |

The curated Lean files retain their original comments and attributions. A clean checkout fetches dependencies from their declared upstream repositories; it does not substitute a private dependency tree.

## Historical research archive

The research handoff is a provenance archive with a broader scope than the curated source tree. It includes third-party PDF references, Isabelle theory files, and source excerpts. Those files retain their own authorship and terms.

[Archive reference inventory](docs/archive-reference-inventory.json) groups the saved PDF references and Isabelle theory files by content hash and records their original paths. It is not a complete license audit of every excerpt in the archive. The corresponding historical manuscript's bibliography, archive source manifests, and original documents should be used to resolve attribution and redistribution terms.

The archive inventory does not establish permission to redistribute every source. Where redistribution is not permitted or remains unresolved, use a reference and source URL instead of a copy. The project's original-work license does not relicense the archive's third-party material.
